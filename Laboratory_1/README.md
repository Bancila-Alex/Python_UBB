First set: For a given natural number n find the minimal natural number m formed with the same digits.
(e.g. n=3658, m=3568).

Second set: Determine a calendar date (as year, month, day) starting from two integer numbers representing the year
and the day number inside that year (e.g. day number 32 is February 1st).
Take into account leap years. Do not use Python's inbuilt date/time functions.

Third set: Determine the n-th element of the sequence 1,2,3,2,2,5,2,2,3,3,3,7,2,2,3,3,3,...
obtained from the sequence of natural numbers by replacing composed numbers with their prime divisors,
each divisor d being written d times, without memorizing the elements of the sequence.
